## What am I trying to build?
- https://inboxnarrator.com/?via=topaitools (Going to replicate this)
- POC in form of Simple Flask Web-App. Might Move to chrome extension
- Going to make it open-source for people to use.
- Going to use a model other than gpt-3?

## Steps:
- Design the email subpackage so you fetch email data for the user (Latest Unread Emails)
- Going to make use of a langchain agent.
- How am I going to get the email data and what will be the frequency e.g every day unread messages?????
- How do I handle pictures and links?
- How am I going to design the prompt?
- Most likely some sort of Conversational Agent
- Which Open-source LLM am I going to use?
- How am I going to convert Text to Voice?
